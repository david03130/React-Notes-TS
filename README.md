# Notes Web App
Simple Notes taking web app to write down quick notes so that you don't forget that thing that you were thinking about earlier.

## Objective and motivations
This is a simple frontend project that I made with the objective of **practicing the use of React + TypeScript for the very first time**. I wanted to see how TypeScript is used within the React framework and gain some experience to be able to develop more complex projects in the future.
I also used this project as an **opportunnity to improve my maquetting and styling skills by creating all the visual components that you'll see in the app myself**.

I also built and implemented a Redux Store from the ground up by myself for the very first time making use of the Redux Toolkit.

## Technologies used
- TypeScript
- React.js
- Redux
